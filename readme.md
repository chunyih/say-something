Say Something
=============

Say Something is a simulated messaging app. Simply run ```home.html``` to start. You can change input user by clicking the user dropdown button.  

Say Something is a part of my data structure experiment with JavaScript. Each message is saved as a node and added to a linked list. To see the list content, launch your browser's debugger console. You many log out different node information by editing the options lines in the enumerate function inside ```script.js```.
