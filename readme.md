Say Something
=============

Say Something is a simulated messaging app built as a part of my data structure experiment with JavaScript. Each message is saved as a node and added to a linked list. Check out the JS Bin demo link to see it run in action. You many log-out different node information by editing options lines in the enumerate function inside the script file.
